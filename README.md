A basic client-side weather app example.  
Uses the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to request weather data.

## WORKSHOP

IDEA - Let's make a super simple weather appplication that runs on the web. You type in the name of a city and get the current temperature for that city. 

### INGREDIENTS
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
  * HTML - The information represented on the page.
  * CSS - The style or look of the information.
  * JAVASCRIPT - The programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage.
  * API - (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the weather data.
  * JSON - The weather data.
  * jQUERY-API - A javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us.
